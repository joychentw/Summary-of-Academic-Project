- **Tools**: Tableau for data visualization and R for the rest of the analysis (techniques: Propensity score matching, logistic regression)
- **Objective**: Understanding what factors cause people to go from freemium to premium on an anonymized real music streaming company nicknamed High Note
- Finding? Peer influence  plays a significant role. PSM is used to match people with similar conditions to exclude compudning factors. There is a positive correlation between subscribing and having friends who are adopters. This might be due to homophily, people who have similar behavior will befriends each other, or it could also be seeing a friend subscribe pushes their friends to subscribe too. High Note could consider engaging in more referral marketing.
